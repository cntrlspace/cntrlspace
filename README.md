### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicole! I used to work as a Civil Engineer, but now Iâ€™m pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Iâ€™m seeking Software Engineering internships to expand my skills and deepen my understanding of the industry. I started my computer science path in January 2022 and I expect to graduate December 2024.
